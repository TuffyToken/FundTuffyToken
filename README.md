# About

TuffyToken is a BEP20 standard token on the Binance Smart Chain created by the CSUF Blockchain club. The FundTuffyToken will be listed on a crypto market, such as Pancake Swap. The token will enable anonymous donation to the Blockchain club, which will reward its contibutors and help fund its projects.

## Token Management

TuffyToken will employ crypto custody solutions to secure a vault wallet. We will use BitGo or similar custody service which requires K out of N signatures to use the funds locked in custody. The custody service, the faculty advisors, the club president, the treasurer will each hold a signature.

## Distribution

### Static Mining

The TuffyToken mining protocol will be similar to that of [Safemoon](https://safemoon.net/). Static mining aims to increase the value of the currency by performing manual buybacks and burns, which will increase scarcity.
Static Mining has two outstanding features. One is security. You have full control of your tokens. Not like liquidity mining, you’ll need to deposit your tokens into a Defi platform which may be vulnerable to hacking. The other feature is energy-efficient. Hardware mining, such as GPU mining, ASIC mining, mining pools, consumes a large amount of electricity.

### Donations

Every transaction(buy/sell) will be “taxed” 10% fee in total. 3% of the fee is distributed to every address that holds TuffyToken. 3% is sent to the club's custody wallet. 4% is split 50/50 to automatically pair BNB-TuffyToken LP providing liquidity on Pancake Swap.

### Contributors

Distribution of tokens to Club members/contributors will parralel that of the [GovTuffyToken](../GovTuffyToken).
Allocating FundTuffyTokens to GovTuffyToken holders will incentivize contributions and accelerate project development.
